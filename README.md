## üì¶ Installation

To get started with the ArduinoMimicSTM32 library, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pandyaparth2407/ArduinoMimicSTM32.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd ArduinoMimicSTM32
   ```

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (STM32CubeIDE recommended).

4. Build and upload the project to your STM32F103 board.

5. Check the **Releases** section for the latest compiled binaries or updates.

## üîó Download

You can find the latest releases of the library [here](https://github.com/pandyaparth2407/ArduinoMimicSTM32/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them in your development environment.

## üìú Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the library, include the header file in your project:

```cpp
#include "BasicTools.h"
```

Create an instance of the class:
